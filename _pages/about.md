 I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, U.S. of A. Since 2017, I have been working under the supervision of [Dr. Danny Dig](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~digd/"). I am a Java enthusiast, and enjoy developing tools for Java developers. My research interest currently is static code analysis, software refactoring and empirical software engineering. 
 I received my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from Mumbai University, Mumbai , India. I have worked as a Java developer for Barclays Investment Bank, Barclays Technology Center India, Pune, India, where I contributed in developing their Trade and Transaction Reporting platform.
